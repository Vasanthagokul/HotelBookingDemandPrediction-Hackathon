## What server is used here?
+ I went with "streamlit" instead of the normal "flask" server hosting method or the "Gunicorn" serving hosting method for my solution as I had only 5 days for this to be completed.

## What database is used?
+ I went with sqllite for it's ease of use and implementation as it had more than the needed querying capabilities.

## How to run it?
+ The following command will run a server and open the webpage that is hosted on that server. Change port number according to your congiguration.
+ Run this command : "streamlit run webpage.py --server.port 8080"
